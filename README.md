# MIUI Debloat-er
Debloat [MIUI](https://c.mi.com/global/miuidownload) using the power of [adb](https://developer.android.com/tools/adb) and [bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell))

I am using an updated version of [this MIUI](https://c.mi.com/global/miuidownload/detail/device/1900369) on a Redmi 7A
