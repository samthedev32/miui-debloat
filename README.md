# MIUI Debloat-er
Debloat [MIUI 12](https://en.miui.com/v12_5) using the power of [adb](https://developer.android.com/tools/adb) and [bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell))

I am testing and making this for [THIS MIUI VERSION](https://xiaomifirmwareupdater.com/miui/pine/stable/V12.5.3.0.QCMEUXM/) for the Xiaomi Redmi 7A (pine)
